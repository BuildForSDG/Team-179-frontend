## About

Aims to ensure health and well-being for all, by focusing on mental health.Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, act and helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices.

## Why

The stigma and scrutiny that comes with being associated with mental illness is one of the rising cause of this illness. People who may have noticed a difference in behavioural attitude desist from evaluating further just because of this stigma.This project aims at creating a forum that addresses that by:

-   Addressing social and geographical isolation experienced by forum members
-   Creating social connection for forum members
-   Provide information and practical advice for forum members

## Usage

How would someone use what you have built, include URLs to the deployed app, service e.t.c when you have it setup


## Setup

Install `npm` or `yarn` if you dont have any of them already installed. We recommend Yarn though.

After clonning the repo to your local machine and moving into the cloned folder, Run `yarn install` to get started by installing dependencies. 

`src/index.js` is the entry to the project and source code should go into the `src` folder.

All tests should be written in the `__tests__' folder. There's a sample in there.

This starter uses [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html) as the bundler. It is much simpler that WebPack and the others

#### Hints

- Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to get started. We'll assume you are using Yarn.
- Install additional dependencies: `yarn add <dependency-name> [-D]`
- Run tests: `yarn test`
- Run tests with test coverage info: `yarn test:cover`
- Check the codebase for proper syntax and formatting compliance: `yarn lint`
- Run your app in local dev mode: `yarn start`. This puts the bundled app in a `dist` folder, set up a local web server at localhost:1234, and continues to watch for your code changes which it syncs with the local server. This means if you loaded the app in a browser, it will auto-refresh as you code along. Feel free to use whatever bundler best meets your needs. Parcel was only added as a sample and for those looking for a simple but effective solution to the hassle of bundlers.

## Contributing

If this project sounds interesting to you and you'd like to contribute, thank you!
First, you can send a mail to buildforsdg@andela.com to indicate your interest, why you'd like to support and what forms of support you can bring to the table, but here are areas we think we'd need the most help in this project :

1.  Feedback on our roadmap and feature list. This app is about promoting mental health
2.  Opt-in and try using your staging app at staging.project-name.com and report any bugs
3.  area three (e.g here is the zoom link to our end-of sprint webinar, join and provide feedback as a stakeholder if you can)
